## Description and rules of the game "Everscale Bet Rates".
```
The player is asked to guess the course in the "wever/usdt" pair according to the Flat Qube DEX data. The course is determined by the logic: how much usdt can be bought for 1 ever, taking into account the commission.
The round lasts 12 hours and closes at 00:00 GMT+0 and 12:00 GMT+0. Bets are accepted from the beginning of the round and end 1 hour before the end of the round. The closing of the round may take place a little later than the declared time, this is due to the technical limitations of the blockchain.
The player can make several bets on different courses to increase his chances of winning. Players who place a bet on the closest course -win. If there are several winners, then the winnings are divided equally between them.
The winning amount is 90% of the sum of bets of all players in the round, 10% is the remuneration for developers.
